## Abstract
> **"How are students (high school and college students) impacted by
mental health?"**
We believe this question is important
because mental health is often stigmatized. To address this concern, we plan to
look at the different resources that students have tackled with mental health in
their lives.

## Keywords
- **_Mental Health_**
- **_Students_**
- **_Resources_**

## Introduction
This project will explore how mental health impacts youth across India. Mental health is an important issue since many students face mental health
challenges and is a commonly stigmatized issue due to its undervalued nature.
In order to address this issue at hand, we will learn how to provide better resources
to student by exploring datasets that illuminate the problems that
they face in regard to mental health. The datasets will
explore some of the challenges that students face such as depression, anxiety,
stress and more. Not only will we look at problems associated with young
people, but we will also explore existing solutions students have used to
tackle these problems. Existing solutions can include self-care resources to
provided resources like the counseling center. Our goal of the project is
to ensure that more students, especially those in the University of Washington,
learn ways to tackle some of the stress and anxiety they face including
self-care and providing outside resources.

## Problem Domain
**Setting/project framing:**
The setting of this topic is in schools all around the world as mental health research and awareness is important everywhere. The research and steps taken to create resources to mitigate these problems is also everywhere making this such a prevalent topic. Mental health awareness and research is so important as it saves lives and since it is a worldwide problem it has impacts of great lengths.

**Sociotechnical situation:**
The mental health impacts of youth in India is a sociotechnical issue, as it deals with the technical research aspects that help produce resources that could help these issues as well as the social and environmental impacts as different cultures and environments have different resources. On top of this, the sociotechnical advances in creating resources to help the youth have advanced drastically. The mix between law and ethics in the psychiatric field has always been a topic of debate as the history of electrotherapy is concerning to hear. The advances in the field of therapy based on research has drastically helped youth that have remedies readily accessible to them.

**Human values:**
Human values that align with this topic are independence, financial security, justice, and simple respect. Independence is very important in these studies because having independence when choosing a resource to or simply not getting treated at all is up to personal discretion. Having the independence to decide is the ethical way to be. Financial security is very vital as money is necessary to conduct this research as well as to receive treatments. Treating mental health crisis is very difficult as it can be very expensive especially for college students. Justice and respect are base values for any type of treatment especially knowing the gruesome history of different treatments. Mental health issues widely impact youth everywhere and this human values need to be considered to think about treatment or any recovery remedy.

**Direct stakeholders:**
Direct stakeholders in this matter are youth around the world that are impacted by mental health issues and could benefit from finding the best resources around them.

**Indirect stakeholders:**
Indirect stakeholders in the matter are researchers all around the world analyzing statistics to potentially help the youth suffering. Parents of youth are also impacted as they are trying to help their loved ones so potential resources are impactful pieces of information.

**Possible harms:**
The possible harms of this topic are dangers to the youth who think mental health problems like depression are normal since such a large population of the youth suffers from some type of mental illness.

**Possible benefits:**
There are a large variety of benefits from this topic as the lives of the future generations are saved due to research like this. If there are more accessible resources that people see, it can help them reach out when they need it and get the right support everyone deserves. All stakeholders benefit and the resources can get expanded to being implemented to all ages.

## Research Questions
1. **Is there a trend between GPA and having a mental health disorder?**
This is important because  we want to know if academics is a reason for students experience mental health problems. We want to provide resources that everyone can do
such as self-care, visiting the counseling center or mental health workshops
in a student’s city if academics may be a leading problem.

2. **How have students taken care of their mental health through self-care?**
This is also another important question since self-care is something that all
students can do to take care of themselves. It’s important that students can
find examples and strategies through e-mail, text messaging and workshops in
order for students to keep their mental health in-check.

3. **What factors increase the risk of mental health problems for college students?**
It’s important to realize that there are a multitude of external factors that
can impact in addition to school. By learning what causes mental health
problems for students, we can focus on finding a variety of resources that
help with stressful situations.

## The Dataset
Before discussing the direct relationship between the dataset and the research
question, I would like to introduce the observations of our dataset. The rows
in our first dataset are our observations, which are college students. The
columns in our first dataset are gender, age, major, current year, CGPA, marital
status, and whether they have the following different kinds of mental illnesses.
The second dataset collected students' psychological disorders due to online
courses and academic stress during the New Crown epidemic. Also, this dataset
explores the correlation between students' stress relief methods and the emergence
of psychological disorders. The third dataset collects the types and proportions
of each psychological disorder in the last two years to help us do a deeper
extension of the study. First, in order to find the common psychological problems
of students, three common psychological disorders are selected in our dataset:
depression, anxiety and panic attack. Through the dataset we can know whether
students have one or more of the three psychological disorders. Second, the dataset
asks whether students seek help from specialists or experience counseling, which
answers the question of students' perceptions and attitudes toward dealing with
mental illnesses. Third, to find the main factors affecting students' mental health,
the dataset collects information about students' school such as CPGA, major, current
year, and other factors such as marital status. This data allow us to explore the
real causes of students' psychological problems.

You can also see the datasets from our docs folder in Github under `~/project-jam860/data/`

MD SHARIFUL ISLAM, the creator of the first dataset, wanted to use this dataset to explore
the impact of mental health on CGPA. He collected the data through Google Form, and no one
has funded the dataset. The only potential beneficiary is him personally, because he needs
to use this dataset to make conclusions about his research topic. The data is confirmed in
three ways: first, the link to this Google Form is only sent to the target student; second,
the student is asked to fill in a lot of school-related information (e.g., major, grade
level, etc.), which raises the threshold for intentional mischief; and third, this dataset
does not directly benefit anyone, so no one would intentionally falsify the data in it.
Therefore, we believe that this data can be relied upon. I attribute this to the source
of the data, because sometimes the data is not publicly available or there is a fee. The
author of the second dataset is Kunal Chaturvedi, who wanted to explore the impact of COVID
on the mental health of students. Similarly to the first author, he also collected the data
through an online form. The rest of it can be referred to the first section. For the third
dataset, the author is the Health and Family Welfare Department of Karnataka, and aims to
explore the situation and number of people with mental illness in different regions. The
government receives their data directly through the health care system, which makes it very reliable
in most cases. Because they are e government entity, there is no need for the government to
cheat on this topic. These datasets were obtained through Kaggle, a free dataset sharing site.

## Expected Implications
Some policymakers ignore students' mental health, while others place great importance on
students' mental health but do not understand the students' situation and needs. Through
our conclusions about the research questions, policymakers may have a basic knowledge about
the mental health of college students. They may go through policies to provide better and
professional counseling services for college students. In addition, policy makers may also
be aware of the sources of mental illness among students and develop relevant policies.
For example, if the primary cause of student mental illness is academic stress (as seen
in the CGPA), then policymakers may require universities to reconsider student workloads.
We think the results may deviate from the designer's expectations because in past studies
we have often discussed the impact of academic stress on mental health but ignored other
factors (e.g., marital status), and our study and data will answer this question.

## Limitations
This study still has some limitations. First, the data set is not large enough nor diverse
enough; in other words, the data from a few dozen students at the same university is not
representative of the entire U.S. college population. To address this limitation, we can
only try to collect data from more schools and more regions to improve our dataset. Second,
we did not list or explore all the factors that affect students' mental health, and the
incompleteness of the factors may lead to bias in our conclusions. As an analogy, it is
possible that a student's family background also affects a student's mental health (many
students have the stress of taking out loans). To address this shortcoming, we need to consider
adding more factors and ensuring the accuracy of our conclusions through the control variables approach.

## Findings
The most common problems that mental health problems that students are facing are depression, ADHD, and anxiety. ADHD being the most common mental health disorder standing at around 9.8 percent of all students stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder which greatly disrupts learning. The second most common is anxiety which affects around 9.4 percent of students. Behavioral issues are also a problem but are sometimes more mild. Last is depression which is very common and sadly the most serious in most cases. Since these are narrowed down, resources can be provided to help these common mental health issues to help the betterment of all communities. Students have taken care of their mental health through self care by practicing breathing techniques in forms such as yoga, or finding other ways to calm themselves such as hobbies or other forms of entertainment. Exercise has been researched as a great form of self care and sometimes plays as a treatment for mental health diagnosis'. This has been adopted as a form of self care for many students. These are good ways to improve these mental health issues which are sadly very prevalent among the world. These resources can also be used in a time where medical help cannot be reached so symptoms can be controlled or improved until medical attention is sought. There are also may factors that impact a students mental health as well as their habits. These reasons are very hard to narrow down, but there are pretty common ones. Stresses regarding school and family life is a big contributor to mental health issues in students. The inability to control what is going on around them can lead to feelings of hopelessness as well as troubles socially. Understanding these factors can make students more aware and they can reach out for help if they feel symptoms. New technology can be designed to help students identify if they need help based on their feelings. Based on this analysis, the implications to designers and policymakers are that they should be more cognizant of these problems and make active efforts to bring attention as well as design policies and ideas around helping people that are suffering.


## Discussion
The importance of this study is that it helps pinpoint the causes, potential solutions, as well of the magnitude of these very real problems. These are very important to address as with these studies more research can be done in how to improve the resources. Now that we know what resources to make more accessible and what information more awareness needs to come to, it is a lot easier for companies and groups to support this cause as the information is there. There is such a large impact with this research as it goes to the length of saving lives. Especially in places with not much access to the internet people are not aware that these problems are very common and are shamed for having these very common feelings. Bringing awareness to these problems as well as spreading methods of self care will drastically help billions of people and it turn make the world a happier as well as safer place. This research help many be involved. The implications of these findings are that a lot more technology will come about for help as well as on all mainstream media. The consequences of these findings are going to save lives and educate future generations to make the world a much better more aware place. People will have their feelings validated and it will be a much smoother experience to overcome these issues.

## Conclusion
This study was about how mental health issues affect youth across the world, mostly focusing on students in India, and it is such a stigmatized issue that this research brought light to the importance of this issue. The key takeaways from this research is that resources to help people suffering can start from something as small as self care. Different self care techniques such as reading, exercise, and meditation all drastically help. If small techniques like this are brought to light, people without access to medical help can sill find ways to get better until they can access medical professionals to asses their needs. Understanding the magnitude of this problems is also a very important factor. People that do not understand how common most mental health issues are, seem very ashamed about how they cannot control their feelings and it seems silly which is what fuels the fire. Understanding that these feelings are completely normal are vital to get better as the necessary steps can be taken to asses the situation which commonly consists of medical assistance. Ignoring vital signs are how conditions worsen and can get to dangerous states. Understanding the common stressors is also a key takeaway of this research as some identified were stresses regarding school and family life. Looking at the broader picture, students at the University of Washington face these issues and this research can greatly help them. Making counseling opportunities and self care remedies more accessible, students at the University of Washington will no how to tackle the problems they are facing and have a more enjoyable experience as well as excel in their studies. Looking at the effects this can happen all around the world and all ages can be confident about reaching out for help. No more being ashamed. Everyone can tackle their mental health issues and continue with the happy life everyone deserves.
