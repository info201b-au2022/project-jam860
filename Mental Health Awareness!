## Abstract
> **"How are students (high school and college students) impacted by
mental health?"**
We believe this question is important
because mental health is often stigmatized. To address this concern, we plan to
look at the different resources that students have tackled with mental health in
their lives.

## Introduction
This project will explore how mental health impacts youth across the United
States. In order to help us better understand how to provide better resources
to students, we will be exploring datasets that illuminate the problems that
they face in regard to mental health. We will explore how indirect and direct
stakeholders play a role in the mental health of youth. The datasets will
explore some of the challenges that students face such as depression, anxiety,
stress and more. Not only will we look at problems associated with young
people, but we will also explore existing solutions students have used to
tackle these problems. Existing solutions can include self-care resources to
provided resources such as the counseling center. Our goal of the project is
to ensure that more students, especially those in the University of Washington,
learn ways to tackle some of the stress and anxiety they face including
self-care and providing outside resources.

## Problem Domain
**Setting/project framing:** 
The setting of this topic is in schools all around the world as mental health research and awareness is important everywhere. The research and steps taken to create resources to mitigate these problems is also everywhere making this such a prevalent topic. Mental health awareness and research is so important as it saves lives and since it is a worldwide problem it has impacts of great lengths. 

**Sociotechnical situation:**
Mental health impacts to youth in the United States is a sociotechnical issue as it deals with the technical research aspects that help produce resources that could help these issues as well as the social and environmental impacts as different cultures and environments have different resources. On top of this, the sociotechnical advances in creating resources to help the youth have advanced drastically. The mix between law and ethics in the psychiatric field has always been a topic of debate as the history of electrotherapy is concerning to hear. The advances in the field of therapy based on research has drastically helped youth that have remedies readily accessible to them. 

**Human values: **
Human values that align with this topic are independence, financial security, justice, and simple respect. Independence is very important in these studies because having independence when choosing a resource to or simply not getting treated at all is up to personal discretion. Having the independence to decide is the ethical way to be. Financial security is very vital as money is necessary to conduct this research as well as to receive treatments. Treating mental health crisis is very difficult as it can be very expensive especially for college students. Justice and respect are base values for any type of treatment especially knowing the gruesome history of different treatments. Mental health issues widely impact youth everywhere and this human values need to be considered to think about treatment or any recovery remedy. 
**Direct stakeholders:** 
Direct stakeholders in this matter are youth around the world that are impacted by mental health issues and could benefit from finding the best resources around them. 
**Indirect stakeholders: **
Indirect stakeholders in the matter are researchers all around the world analyzing statistics to potentially help the youth suffering. Parents of youth are also impacted as they are trying to help their loved ones so potential resources are impactful pieces of information. 
**Possible harms:**
The possible harms of this topic are dangers to the youth who think mental health problems like depression are normal since such a large population of the youth suffers from some type of mental illness. 
**Possible benefits:** 
There are a large variety of benefits from this topic as the lives of the future generations are saved due to research like this. If there are more accessible resources that people see, it can help them reach out when they need it and get the right support everyone deserves. All stakeholders benefit and the resources can get expanded to being implemented to all ages.

## Research Questions
1. **What are the most common mental health problems students are facing?**
This is important since there are many types of mental health issues that
students are often faced with. We want to provide resources that everyone can do
such as self-care, visiting the counseling center or mental health workshops
in a student’s city.

2. **In what ways have students found or sought out resources to address their
mental health problem?**
This is also another important question since some students address their
mental health problems in a variety of ways, while others don’t address them at
all. It’s important that students can find resources through e-mail, text
messaging and events so that students can keep their mental health in-check.
3. **What are the leading factors that impact a student’s mental health?**
It’s important to realize that there are a multitude of external factors that
can impact in addition to school. By learning what causes mental health
problems for students, we can focus on finding a variety of resources that
help with stressful situations.
