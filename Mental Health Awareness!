## Abstract
> **"How are students (high school and college students) impacted by
mental health?"**
We believe this question is important
because mental health is often stigmatized. To address this concern, we plan to
look at the different resources that students have tackled with mental health in
their lives.

## Introduction
This project will explore how mental health impacts youth across the United
States. In order to help us better understand how to provide better resources
to students, we will be exploring datasets that illuminate the problems that
they face in regard to mental health. We will explore how indirect and direct
stakeholders play a role in the mental health of youth. The datasets will
explore some of the challenges that students face such as depression, anxiety,
stress and more. Not only will we look at problems associated with young
people, but we will also explore existing solutions students have used to
tackle these problems. Existing solutions can include self-care resources to
provided resources such as the counseling center. Our goal of the project is
to ensure that more students, especially those in the University of Washington,
learn ways to tackle some of the stress and anxiety they face including
self-care and providing outside resources.

## Problem Domain

## Research Questions
1. **What are the most common mental health problems students are facing?**
This is important since there are many types of mental health issues that
students are often faced with. We want to provide resources that everyone can do
such as self-care, visiting the counseling center or mental health workshops
in a student’s city.

2. **In what ways have students found or sought out resources to address their
mental health problem?**
This is also another important question since some students address their
mental health problems in a variety of ways, while others don’t address them at
all. It’s important that students can find resources through e-mail, text
messaging and events so that students can keep their mental health in-check.
3. **What are the leading factors that impact a student’s mental health?**
It’s important to realize that there are a multitude of external factors that
can impact in addition to school. By learning what causes mental health
problems for students, we can focus on finding a variety of resources that
help with stressful situations.
